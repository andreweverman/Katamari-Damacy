# Karamari Damacy Clone

### For my final project for a Computer Game Animation Course, I recreated the game Katamari Damacy. In this game you are a ball that picks up objects along the way that stick, allowing you to grow and pick up other objects of larger mass. The final demo for this project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/UXciHuvQwa4).
